# Candle Shop

<a href="https://candle-shop-dev.netlify.app/">LIVE DEMO</a>

An online store selling soy candles. The main goal of the project was to design the customer order process. React-hook-forms library was used to create the forms and yup library was used to validate the data entered into the form. REST API (Realtime Database - Firebase) was used to retrieve the product database and send order details.
